# House Pricing Prediction

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. 

This project includes the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the relationships between features and their impact on house prices.
3. **Modeling**: Building machine learning models to predict house prices.
4. **Model Tuning**: Optimizing the models to improve prediction accuracy.

The insights and predictions from this project can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions in the real estate market.
