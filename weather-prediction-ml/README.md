# Weather Prediction Project

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to predict weather conditions such as temperature and precipitation using machine learning models. 

This project includes the following steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and visualizing key relationships between features.
2. **Modeling**: Building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to predict weather conditions.
3. **Model Tuning**: Optimizing the best-performing model for improved accuracy and reliability.
4. **API Development**: Creating a REST API using Flask to allow real-time predictions via Postman.

This project demonstrates the integration of data analysis, machine learning, and API development to build a complete predictive solution.
