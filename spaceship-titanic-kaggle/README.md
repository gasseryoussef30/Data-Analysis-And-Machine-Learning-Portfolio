# Spaceship Titanic Prediction

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to predict which passengers survived the Spaceship Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques. 

This project includes the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the dataset by handling missing values and engineering features for better model performance.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing patterns and relationships in the data to understand survival factors.
3. **Modeling**: Building machine learning models to predict passenger survival.
4. **Model Tuning**: Optimizing the models to improve prediction accuracy.

The final model provides valuable insights into the factors influencing passenger survival and achieves high accuracy on the test set.
